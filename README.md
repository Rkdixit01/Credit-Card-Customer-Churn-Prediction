# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction
# Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in credit card services using machine learning. It employs feature extraction, encoding techniques, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to achieve a high prediction accuracy.

# Objective
To identify potential churners based on customer data and improve prediction accuracy through iterative optimization of the ANN model.

# Features
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and performed encoding for categorical variables.
ANN Architecture: Used TensorFlow and Keras (Sequential model) to design the network with input, hidden, and output layers.
Optimization: Increased the number of epochs, hidden layers, and nodes to enhance efficiency.
# Efficiency
Achieved an accuracy of 85% after optimizing the ANN model.

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
